### Individual Project

There are three Individual Project folders, one per team member.

#### Individual Final Project report

This folder contains the individual team members final project report in pdf format.

#### Code

This folder contains the individual team members code contributions in standalone
form, separated from the combined collaboratively developed whole.
TODO: Very unclear on what actually goes in here... does the code in here have to
function on it's own? or be snippets that only work when combined with the whole?
